/*
Define styles that can be applied outside of Polymer's custom CSS properties
implementation. Some of the use-cases include defining styles that you want to
be applied for a splash screen, styles for your application 'shell' before it
gets upgraded using Polymer or critical style blocks that you want parsed
before your elements are.
