		"about": "Hi, I'm Ed— \n\n I am a Digital Designer from Sydney.",
		"more": "and I specialise in UX and UI design of digital products. I started my career freelancing in 2011, working mostly with small businesses and individuals on websites. I graduated from Billy Blue College of Design, Sydney in 2014, where I completed a Bachelor of Applied Design (Digital Media). Shortly after I graduated I started a full-time UI/UX Designer position at a Digital Product Design Studio in Sydney where I have worked for the last 18 months. \n\n During that time, I have been involved projects for startups and big brands including Dick Smith, Hurley, Mortgage House, and NAB to name a few. I have experience in user experience research and design, user interface design, even a bit of front-end development (currently im learning Polymer). Combining visuals, animation, and interactivity with design and code is my passion, and something I'm eager to continue to explore and develop. \n\n I’m often filling my spare time with side-projects, and if it's not side projects you'll most likely find me cleaning my sneaker collection or playing a board game. \n\n Thanks for the taking the time to have a look through my work.",
